# Basic_Server
This is a basic python Host-Client server
Using python sockets I'm able to create a basic host-client connection that can exchange strings with one another
A connection can be established with other devices but you need to make sure they are on the same private network and that the client.py code changes SERVER to the same local ip address of the Host.
